<h2 style="color:#800000"><br>Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">
    A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), sometimes referred to as a ConvNet, is the most well-known image
    recognition and classification algorithm.  CNNs were one of the key innovations that led to the deep
    neural network renaissance in computer vision, which is a subset of machine learning.

<h2 style="color:#800000">Architecture<br></h2>

<p style="font-size:20px">
    <br>A typical CNN consists of a combination of convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected layers.
</p>
<h5>1. Convolutional Layer</h5>
<p style="font-size:20px">
    This layer is the first layer that is used to extract the various features from the input images.
    In this layer, the mathematical operation of convolution is performed between the input image and a
    filter of a particular size MxM. By sliding the filter over the input image, the dot product is taken
    between the filter and the parts of the input image with respect to the size of the filter (MxM).
</p>
<h5>2. Pooling Layer</h5>
<p style="font-size:20px">
    In most cases, a Convolutional Layer is followed by a Pooling Layer. The primary aim of this layer is to
    decrease the size of the convolved feature map to reduce the computational costs. This is performed by
    decreasing the connections between layers and independently operates on each feature map. Depending upon
    method used, there are several types of Pooling operations.<br>
    In Max Pooling, the largest element is taken from feature map. Average Pooling calculates the average of the
    elements in a predefined sized Image section. The total sum of the elements in the predefined section is
    computed in Sum Pooling. The Pooling Layer usually serves as a bridge between the Convolutional Layer and
    the FC Layer.
</p>
<h5>3. Fully Connected Layer</h5>
<p style="font-size:20px">
    The Fully Connected (FC) layer consists of the weights and biases along with the neurons and is used to connect
    the neurons between two different layers. These layers are usually placed before the output layer and form the
    last few layers of a CNN Architecture.<br>
    In this, the input image from the previous layers are flattened and fed to the FC layer. The flattened vector
    then undergoes few more FC layers where the mathematical functions operations usually take place. In this
    stage, the classification process begins to take place.
</p>
<h2 style="color:#800000">Transfer Learning</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">
    Transfer learning is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. It's currently very popular in deep
    learning because it can train deep neural networks with comparatively little data.<br>
    In this project I used transfer learning to reuse a better pre-trained model up till the last fully-connected
    layer, which is responsible for the output. So, instead of hundreds of neurons in the last layer, we
    only have two. One gives the probability of covid and other of no covid.
</p>
<h2 style="color:#800000">ResNet-18</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">
    ResNet, short for Residual Network is a specific type of neural network that was introduced in 2015 by Kaiming
    He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun in their paper “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition”.<br>
    ResNet-18 is an extremely deep CNN, which I have used in this Project using transfer learning.
