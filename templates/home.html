    <p style="font-size:20px">
        CoviTest is an app that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict whether a patient has
            the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or not, when provided with a computed tomography scan (CT scan).
        This would be extremely helpful for early diagnosis of Covid-19.

    As you can see above, the images are very similar. Hence, the model will extract the features out of these
        images, and then try to predict if the patient has covid or not based off of these features. This type of
        problem is called a binary classification problem as we need to predict whether a particular image is
        covid negative (0) or covid positive (1).
